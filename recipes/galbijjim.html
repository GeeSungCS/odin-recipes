            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Trim off any excess fat. Rinse the ribs and let them sit in
                    cold water for about 30 minutes to draw out excess blood.
                    Drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large pot, bring 5 cups of water to a boil over high
                    heat along with the onion, ginger, garlic and scallion white
                    parts. Add the short ribs, and bring it to a boil,
                    uncovered, skimming off the foam. Reduce the heat to medium
                    high and cook for about 10 minutes. Remove the ribs to a
                    plate, reserving the stock.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strain the stock, and skim off the fat. (Refrigerating the
                    stock will help the fat solidify for easier removal. If you
                    have room in the freezer, the process will go faster.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix together all the braising liquid ingredients, except the
                    sesame oil. Return the ribs to the pot. Pour the braising
                    liquid over the meat and stir. (You can prepare the ribs up
                    to this point the day before, and finish braising when you
                    need to serve.)
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables and optional garnish.</li>
                <li>
                    Add 2.5 cups of the reserved stock to the ribs. Cover and
                    bring it to a boil over medium heat. Continue to boil for 20
                    to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the ribs. Stir
                    in the radish, mushrooms, and carrots. Continue to boil,
                    covered, for about 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the optional garnish ingredients. Return to boil,
                    uncovered this time, for an additional 10 minutes, or until
                    the sauce is thicker and the meat is tender but not falling
                    apart. Add the green parts of scallions and the sesame oil
                    and stir gently before turning the heat off.
