        <h2>Kimchi Bokkeumbap (김치 볶음밥)</h2>
        <p>
            Kimchi Fried Rice, also known as Kimchi Bokkeumbap (김치 볶음밥) in
            Korean, is a popular type of Korean fried rice. It is predominantly
            made by stir frying kimchi (a traditional Korean side dish of
            fermented spicy napa cabbage) and rice, along with various
            seasonings.
